      >Wie Gehts! My name is Michael Corrieri and I'm a Software Engineer based
      in Brooklyn. I enjoy incorporating my passion for coding with the
      communication skills and research experience I gained while completing my
      Masters of Public Health degree. As a developer I strive to continually
      incorporate new tools into my repertoire, keep up with modern technologies
      and best practices, while writing readable and reusable code. I am excited
      to build solutions and improve software for ineffective practices within
      healthcare and wellness industries.</v-card-text
