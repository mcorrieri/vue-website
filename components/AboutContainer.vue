      >Wie Gehts! My name is Michael Corrieri and I'm a Software Developer based
      in Brooklyn. I enjoy incorporating my passion for coding with the
      communication skills and research experience I gained while completing my
      Masters of Public Health degree. As a developer I strive to continually
      incorporate new tools into my repertoire, keep up with modern technologies
      and best practices, while writing DRY code. If I'm not coding I'm probably
      at the gym or working on my aquariums.</v-card-text
